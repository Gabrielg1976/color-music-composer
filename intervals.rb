# These intervals are to be combined into chords and possibly scales.
# The list below consists of the shorthand name for the interval, followed
# by the number of semitones which that interval increases the preceeding note.
# The interval designations are as follow: Perfect Unison, minor 2ND, Major 2ND,
# minor 3RD, Major 3RD, Perfect 4TH, Augmented 4TH, Diminished 5TH, Perfect 5TH,
# minor 6TH, Major 6TH, minor 7TH, Major 7TH, Perfect Octave.

# This deviates a bit from standardized notation for the interval names.

# be tricky to work with and/or conflicting with other aspects of the code. 

# The following code is intended to take a note input along with the desired
# interval and also the direction of motion and calculate the following note
# value. A rhizome creates both roots and shoots and spawns genetic thoughts :)
